# KDN
A web application project done in school in a team of two.

Korean Dream Night (KDN) was formed from our love for KPOP since our teenage years and then decided to make this dream of working 
with them come to life.

Its a web application that allows users to purchase their (one-night only) tickets to a multi-group kpop concert.
